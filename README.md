# C Calculator

This project is a **simple calculator written in C**, designed to perform basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo. It also demonstrates the use of //modular programming\\ in C.

## Features

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (with error handling)
- Modulo
- Command-line interface

## Code Structure

The project uses a modular design:
- `main.c` – Entry point of the program
- `calll.c` / `calc.h` – Contains the mathematical operation functions
